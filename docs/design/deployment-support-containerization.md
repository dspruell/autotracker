# AutoTracker application - containerization design

This document provides information for the design and planning of containerized deployment support in the AutoTracker application.

You are a software engineer and architect with experience and strong skills in design and containerizing full stack web applications in modern Python 3 with the Django MVC framework. Produce a design that can containerize this web application and meets the following requirements.

## Containerization

* Container deployment is optional, and is not the default or the only option. The containerization phase of the project will add support for Dockerizing deployment with Docker Compose and Kubernetes. Initial phases of application design will not consider these points.
* In the later containerization phase, it will be ideal to have a maintainable Dockerfile that can be used, and to be able to deploy this easily with Docker Compose or Kubernetes if a user wishes. If possible, include artifacts for these in the design, and/or produce clear and simple, straightforward documentation on these deployment scenarios.

1. Support containerization in Docker and deployment with Docker Compose.
2. Include a maintainable Dockerfile in the project.
3. Include a maintainable Docker Compose file for users that want to deploy the project using Docker Compose.
4. Include artifacts for these things in the design, and produce clear and simple, straightforward documentation on these deployment scenarios.
